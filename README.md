## How to use

## Rules 

1) Live cell with two or less  live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2) Live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overcrowding).
3) Live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on.
4) Dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

## Why is it interesting? 

Life is a great example of how very complex and elaborate patterns can emerge from simple set of rules.
